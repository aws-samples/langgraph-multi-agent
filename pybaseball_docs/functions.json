{"statcast": {"docs": "# Statcast\n`statcast(start_dt=[yesterday's date], end_dt=None, team=None, verbose=True, parallel=True)`\n\nThe `statcast` function retrieves pitch-level statcast data for a given date or range or dates. \n\n## Returned data\nThis function returns a pandas `DataFrame` with one entry for each pitch in the\nquery. The data returned for each pitch is explained on\n[Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).\n\n## Arguments\n`start_dt:` first day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to yesterday's date if nothing is entered. If you only want data for one date, supply a `start_dt` value but not an `end_dt` value. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \n\n`end_dt:` last day for which you want to retrieve data. Defaults to None. If you want to retrieve data for more than one day, both a `start_dt` and `end_dt` value must be given. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. \n\n`team:` optional. If you only want statcast data for one team, supply that team's abbreviation here (i.e. BOS, SEA, NYY, etc).\n\n`verbose:` Boolean, default=True. If set to True this will provide updates on query progress, if set to False it will not. \n\n`parallel:` Boolean, default=True. Whether to parallelize HTTP requests in large queries.\n\n### A note on data availability \nThe earliest available statcast data comes from the 2008 season when the system was first introduced to Major League Baseball. Queries before this year will not work. Further, some features were introduced after the 2008 season. Launch speed angle, for example, is only available from the 2015 season forward. \n\n### A note on query time\nBaseball savant limits queries to 30000 rows each. For this reason, if your request is for a period of greater than 5 days, it will be broken into two or more smaller requests. The data will still be returned to you in a single dataframe, but it will take slightly longer. \n\n### A note on parallelization\nLarge queries with requests made in parallel complete substantially faster. This option exists to accommodate compute environments where multiprocessing is disabled (e.g. some AWS Lambda environments).\n\n## Examples of valid queries\n\n```python\nfrom pybaseball import statcast\n\n# get all statcast data for July 4th, 2017\ndata = statcast('2017-07-04')\n\n#get data for the first seven days of August in 2016\ndata = statcast('2016-08-01', '2016-08-07')\n\n#get all data for the Texas Rangers in the 2016 season\ndata = statcast('2016-04-01', '2016-10-30', team='TEX')\n\n# get data for yesterday\ndata = statcast()```\n", "data_dictionary": "\npitch_type\nThe type of pitch derived from Statcast.\n\ngame_date\nDate of the Game.\n\nrelease_speed\nPitch velocities from 2008-16 are via Pitch F/X, and adjusted to roughly out-of-hand release point.

The abbreviation of the team for which you are requesting data (e.g. \"PHI\", \"BOS\", \"LAD\"). \n\nNote that if a team did not exist during the year you are requesting data for, the query will be unsuccessful. Historical name and city changes for teams in older seasons can cause some problems as well. The Los Angeles Dodgers (\"LAD\"), for example, are abbreviated \"BRO\" in older seasons, due to their origins as the Brooklyn Dodgers. This may at times require some detective work in certain cases.   \n\n## Examples of valid queries\n\n```python\nfrom pybaseball import schedule_and_record\n\n# Game-by-game results from the Yankees' 1927 season\ndata = schedule_and_record(1927, \"NYY\")\n\n# Results and upcoming schedule for the Phillies' current season (2017 at the time of writing)\ndata = schedule_and_record(2017, \"PHI\")\n```\n", "data_dictionary": "Date: date the game was played\nTm: team\nHome_Away: indicator of Home (Home) or Away (@) game\nOpp: opponenet\nW/L: Win or Loss indicator\nR: runs scored\nRA: runs allowed\nInn: innings played\nW-L: team's win-loss record after the game end\nRank: team's ranking in the division\nGB: how many games back (or up) the team is in the divion\nWin: winning pitcher\nLoss: losing pitcher\nSave: saving pitcher\nTime: game duration\nD/N: day or night game indicator\nAttendance: game attendance\ncLI: Championship Leverage Index.
