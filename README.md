# Multi-Agent Data Analysis Assistant with LangGraph

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how LangGraph can be used to build a stateless multi-agent workflow to serve as an assistant for data analysis.  This workflow leverages the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) Python library to extract data which is then used for analysis based on the user's request.

The workflow consists of two agent systems: one for general workflow and planning and another for code generation and execution.  An Agent is fundamentally a language model on a loop until some stopping condition is met, and a Graph is what we use to define the loop. For this reason, "Agent" and "Graph" are used interchangeably in this documentation.

The graphs are organized in a modular manner so that each node serves a specific purpose.

## Sample Usage

The sample notebooks demonstrate three simple use cases as examples of how this system can be used.  

```
1.  How many home runs did Derek Jeter hit in 2010?
```

```
2.  Plot the cumulative sum of strikeouts thrown by Danny Duffy in the 2018 season.
```

```
3.  Consider the first week of August 2020 - find 3 pitchers who's curveballs were most similar to Max Scherzer's.
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository and navigate to the `langgraph-multi-agent` folder 
2. Update local `env` file with the required environment variables and rename to `.env`
3. deploy Redis locally

`docker run -d -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest`

If things are running correctly you should see a nice Redis UI at http://localhost:8001.

## Running the Jupyter Notebooks
1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Open and execute the sample Jupyter Notebooks in order.  You must ensure that the Jupyter notebook is running a python kernel tied to the virtual environment you have created so that the required libraries will be available.  

The intent of the sample notebooks is to first demonstrate a use case that is unknown to the agent system, and then to demonstrate a slight variation of the same use case after the system has learned the pattern.
